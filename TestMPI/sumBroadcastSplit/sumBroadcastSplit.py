# This file does: Runs a parallelized version of nonParallelSumBroadcastSplit
#                 It splits a list of fitting factor combinations among 'num_processors' processors, has them
#                 sum up all of the fitting factor combinations they have, returns the sum to the root processor (0),
#                 the root processor adds up the sums from each of the processors and writes this sum to a file
