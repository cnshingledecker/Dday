fitting factors for reactions linspaces (1 line per delta value that you want to change, line contains the following arguments to create the linspace): start, end, num_samples. 
Assuming that the indexing of lines in this file starts at 1 (it does for me in VS Code on Windows 10), the values for a linspace on line n are used to create a linspace whose values 
appear in fitting_factor_combination[n - 3] (where fitting_factor_combination is an array containing a combination of values (one from each of the linspaces))
