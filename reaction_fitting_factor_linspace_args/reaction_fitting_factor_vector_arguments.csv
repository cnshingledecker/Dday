fitting factors for reactions linspaces (1 line per fitting factor that you want to change, line contains the following arguments to create the numpy linspace): start, end, num_samples. 
Assuming that the indexing of lines in this file starts at 1 (it does for me in VS Code on Windows 10), the values for a linspace on line n are used to create a linspace whose values 
appear in fitting_factor_combination[n - 5] in the baragiola optimization (where fitting_factor_combination is an array containing a combination of values (one from each of the linspaces)).
The general structure of a line is: linspace argument, linspace argument, linspace argument, reaction for which the linspace's values are fitting factors
