Problem seems to be happening in surface high energy molecules (marked g), not andything below (marked b - bulk/below), this is how it was previously slightly fixed

Line 406 in mod_run_dvode has some yabundace alculations 

Line 762 - Location of 'Time (s) = ', t

Line 792 - Location of write % of initial atoms in y-array.
         - changed to have 4 decimal places for more precision

Line 794 to line - Adding a tracker to find the abundances over time (only records y-array abundance and time)

baragiola_generalized_parallel.py change - line 66 added y-array_over_time.csv to list so it can be opened and edited.
